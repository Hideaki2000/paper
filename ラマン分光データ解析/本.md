### Baseline estimation and denoising:problem formulation

$$\begin{equation}
  \bold{s}=\bold{x}+\bold{f},\space \bold{s}\in \R^N
\end{equation}$$

the vector $\bold{x}$,consisting of numerous peaks, is modeled as a sparse-devrivative signal.The vector $\bold{f}$,representating the baseline , is low-pass signal. We further model the observed chromatogra data as

$$\begin{equation}
  \bold{y}=\bold{s}+\bold{f}+\bold{w},\space \bold{y} \in \R^N
\end{equation}$$
where $\bold{w}$ is stationary white Gaussian process with variance $\sigma^2$. Our goal is to estimate the baseline,$\bold{f}$ and peaks, $\bold{x}$,simultaneously,from observation $\bold{y}$.
 We assume that if peaks are absent, then the baseline can be approximately recovered from a noise-corrupted observation from by low-pass filtering. we may obtain an estimate $\hat{\bold{f}}$ of baseline by filtering $\bold{y}$ in (7) in with low pass filter $\bold{L}$,

 $$\begin{equation}
   \hat{\bold{f}}=\bold{L}(\bold{y}-\hat{\bold{x}})
 \end{equation}
 $$
 In this case, we may obtain an etimate $\hat{\bold{s}}$ by adding $\hat{\bold{x}}$

from (1)
$$\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \hat{\bold{s}}&=\hat{\bold{x}}+\hat{\bold{f}}\\
                   &=\bold{L}(\bold{y}-\hat{\bold{x}})+\hat{\bold{x}}\\
                   &=\bold{L}(\bold{y})-(\bold{I}-\bold{L})(\hat{\bold{x}})\\
                   &=\bold{L}(\bold{y})+\bold{H}(\hat{\bold{x}}) \space (\bold{H}=\bold{I}-\bold{L})
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$
where $\bold{H}$ is high pass filter.
　In order to obtain $\hat{\bold{x}}$ of chromatgraph peaks from the observed data $\bold{y}$, We will formulate an inverse problem with the quadratic data fidelity term $\|\bold{y}-\hat{\bold{s}}\|$. Note that

$$\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\|\bold{y}-\hat{\bold{s}}\|_2^2&=\|\bold{y}-\bold{Ly}-\bold{H\hat{x}}\|_2^2\\
                              &=\|\bold{H}(\bold{y}-\bold{\hat{x}})\|_2^2  
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}$$

Hence,the data fidelity term in the proposed formulation depends on the high-pass filter $\bold{H}$.Also note that the data fidelity term does not depend on the baseline estimate $\hat{\bold{f}}$. The optimization problem,formulated below. preduces an estimate of the chromatogram peaks $\hat{\bold{x}}$. The baseline estimate is then obtained by (3)

### Compound sparse derivative modeling
 According to (1),the first i derivatives, $i=0,\dotsb,M$ of the esimated peaks,should be sparse. In sparse signal processing, sparse signal behavior is typically acheved through the use of suitable non-quadratic regulation terms. Therefore, to obtain an estimate $\hat{\bold{x}}$, the following optimization problem is proposed:
 $$\begin{equation}
 \hat{\bold{x}}=arg\space \min\left(F(\bold{x})=\frac{1}{2}\|\bold{H}(\bold{y}-\bold{x})\|_2^2+\sum^M_{i=0}\lambda_i\bold{R}_i(\bold{D_i\bold{x}})\right)
 \end{equation}$$
 The assumptiion that the observed data is corruptedn by additive white Gaussian noise(AWGN) is reflected in the use of a quadratic data fitting term as in classical. The quadratic data fidelity term is given by (5).
 $\bold{D}_i$ is the order-i difference operator.
 Functions $R_i:\R^{N-i}\rightarrow\R$, are of the form
 $$\begin{equation}
   R_i(\bold{v})=\sum_n\phi(\bold{v}_n)
 \end{equation}$$
where $N_i$ denotes the length of $\bold{D_i}x$. The constants $\lambda_i\geq 0$ are regulation parameters. Increasing $\lambda_i$ has the effect of making $\bold{D}_i x$ more sparse.
 this work introduces several modifications to adapt the approach therein to chromatograms. The novel features of the approach proposed here include: 
 
 - an M-term compound regularizer to model chromatogram peaks
 - The modeling of the positivity of chromatgram peaks by non-symmetric penalties
 - An improved algorithm based on MM for compound regularization
